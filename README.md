# randomEfforts
Just a random repo containing various Python codes mostly implementing some Python concept
for example:
HOF.py has the implementation of Lambda functions in Higher Order Functions, a higher order function was created to
return the sum of even, odd and numbers divisible by 3 simultaneously from a List.
